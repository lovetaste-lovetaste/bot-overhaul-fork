This is a heavily edited version of Showin's bot overhaul
(heavily edited as in practically seperate things aside from a couple important functions that i was too lazy to make myself)

ive only posted the spy changes as that is the one im focusing the most on right now. After that comes Pyro changes.
Bot Commands to put into whatever server cfg you have:


nb_head_aim_resettle_angle 180


nb_head_aim_resettle_time 1.2


nb_head_aim_settle_duration 1.2


nb_head_aim_steady_max_rate 0.5


This makes the bot more realistic, as it gives them more humanlike reaction times.

If you REALLY want to see the spy bot and how much its improved versus the stock bots:
make sure to put the GiveBotsMoreWeapons_Pub plugin, and set the bots to easy (tf_bot_difficulty 0)
